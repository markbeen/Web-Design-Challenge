## Web-Design-Challenge
##### The aim of this exercise is to deploy an interactive website that displays relationships between latitude and weather. Four weather are evaluated: (1) temperature, (2) humidity, (3) cloudiness, and (4) wind speed.  


##### My files were pushed to my GitHub repo *Web-Design-Challenge*. Here's a link to the deployed site: https://markbeen.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

##### Some notables regarding this exercise:
* Much of the website uses Bootstrap. I found YouTube videos describing the basics of Bootstrap by Academind very helpful ([*Bootstrap by Academind*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8Gg2QVdeU)).

  * The *grid* and sizing the grid to accommodate different screens (i.e. phone vs monitor) are two important concepts.

* My initial site deployments were flawed because of incorrect path references. This issue was easily remedied. 
* When I first deployed the site to the GitHub repo, the implementation failed. I reminded myself how do deploy on GitHub by watching this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA_c3bGQXlQ).
  * In short, one needs to move the *index.html* file to the root directory of the repo. If, on your local machine, you created/edited the *index.html* page in a subdirectory, then you have to move *index.html* **and** all file dependents.
