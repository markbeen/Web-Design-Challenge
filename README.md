## Web-Design-Challenge
##### The aim of this exercise is to deploy an interactive website that displays relationships between latitude and weather. Four weather are evaluated: (1) temperature, (2) humidity, (3) cloudiness, and (4) wind speed.  


##### My files were pushed to my GitHub repo *Web-Design-Challenge*. Here's a link to the deployed site: https://markbeen.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/

##### Some notables regarding this exercise:
* Much of the website uses Bootstrap. I found youtube videos describing the basics of Bootstrap by Academind very helpful ([*Bootstrap by Academind*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7g8Gg2QVdeU))
